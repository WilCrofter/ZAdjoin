# ZAdjoin

A module implementing arithmetic over Z[α], the integers with α adjoined, where α satisfies a polynomial relations of the form α^n = p(α) = p[1] + p[2]α + ... + p[n]α^(n-1). For instance if α^2 = -1, Z[α] would be the [Gaussian, or complex, integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_integer). Rings of this form are of some interest in number theory.

Such a ring may be implemented as a ring of integer polynomials modulo α^n-p(α) or as the matrix ring over the integers which is generated by the companion matrix of α^n-p(α). This module uses polynomial arithmetic to implement addition, multiplication and exponentiation, but can convert ring elements to matrix form.

The module was written primarily for exercise with Julia's custom type system. It is implemented as a package but has been developed primarily as a module. Until there is documentation, the following indicates its use (as a module):

```
julia> include("path/to/ZAdjoin.jl") # not required if installed as a package.
ZAdjoin

julia> using ZAdjoin

julia> mod = Modulus([-1, 0]) # Gaussian integers
Modulus{Int64}
α^2 = -1

julia> a = Element([0,1],mod)
Element{Int64}
+1α

julia> b = Element([1,1],mod)
Element{Int64}
1+1α

julia> a^2
Element{Int64}
-1

julia> a*b
Element{Int64}
-1+1α

julia> a+b
Element{Int64}
1+2α

julia> Matrix(b^19)
2×2 Array{Int64,2}:
 -512  -512
  512  -512

julia> Matrix(b)^19
2×2 Array{Int64,2}:
 -512  -512
  512  -512
```
