# ZAdjoin

A module implementing arithmetic over Z[α], the integers with α adjoined, where α satisfies a polynomial relationsof the form α^n = p(α) = p[1] + p[2]α + ... + p[n]α^(n-1). For instance if α^2 = -1, Z[α] would be the [Gaussian, or complex, integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_integer). Rings of this form are of some interest in number theory.

Such a ring may be implemented as a ring of integer polynomials modulo α^n-p(α) or as the matrix ring over the integers which is generated by the companion matrix of α^n-p(α). This module uses polynomial arithmetic to implement addition, multiplication and exponentiation, but can convert ring elements to matrix form.

The module was written primarily for exercise with Julia's custom type system. It is implemented as a package but has been developed primarily as a module.
